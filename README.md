# ArduinoWebTemperature
Arduino Webserver using Blynk to read Temperature sensor A0 and A Led on Pin 7

With the help of the Blynk app you can create your own (Temperature) Server with an Arduino and an Ethernet Shield.
To controll the LED and to see the temperature sensor from the Arduino Server you must download Blynk app and add a sensor value 'lcd' in the app and a button (to controll the LED) and connect (in the app) the button to PIN 7. <- all these are made in the app, on the Arduino you just have to connect the Ethernet shield, a LED to pin 7 and a temperature sensor to pin A0.
